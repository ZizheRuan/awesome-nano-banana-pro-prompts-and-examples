# 🍌 Awesome Nano Banana 2 Images Prompt Gallery (Preview) 🍌


## 🔍 Introduction
awesome-nano-banana-2-images is a curated, community-driven collection of high-quality prompts and stunning outputs generated with the **Nano Banana 2 (Google Gemini 3.0 Pro Image)** model, currently accessible through *third-party preview APPs*.  
This repository aims to help creators, researchers, and prompt engineers better understand how to craft effective prompts for the model during its pre-release phase.

## 📌 What This Repository Contains
- Community-shared prompts that produce high-quality or interesting results  
- Example images generated via preview-access Nano Banana 2 endpoints  
- Notes, tips, and reverse-prompt insights from real-world usage  

## 🎯 Purpose
This project serves as a practical reference for anyone experimenting with the Nano Banana 2 model. By collecting public examples and prompts from across the community, we aim to:
- Showcase what the model can achieve  
- Explore prompt patterns that lead to strong outputs  
- Help users learn and iterate faster

## ✨ Cases

### Case 0: [Turn item into cyberpunk style with text](https://copictor.com/case/nanobananapro)（by [@ZizheRuan](https://x.com/ZizheRuan)）

| Input | Output |
|:---:|:---:|
| <img src="images/0_i.jpg" width="200" alt="Input Image"> | <img src="images/0_o.jpg" width="200" alt="Output Result"> |


**input:** a reference image

**prompt:**

```
A highly imaginative, ultra-cool, eye-catching cyberpunk-inspired banana artwork in vivid, neon-saturated colors. A single banana occupies most of the frame, rendered in a surreal, futuristic, abstract style that clearly does not resemble the real world. 1:1 aspect ratio. Add three lines of English text: ‘Nano’, ‘Banana’, ‘Pro’. The text should not block the banana too much, but may slightly overlap if needed. Extremely stylish, futuristic, and visually striking.
```
```
以香蕉为主题，生成一张最炫酷吸睛，色彩鲜艳的香蕉主题图片，可以是抽象的赛博朋克主题，场景要非常炫酷，一看就不是真实世界，而是高度想象力的，横纵比例1:1，香蕉要占据主要面积，图上加三行英文文字，分别是"Nano""Banana""Pro"，尽量不要挡住香蕉，但也可以盖在一小部分香蕉上面，不要出现中文
```
