⭐ Please Star or Watch this project for future updates!

last updated: Nov 27th 2025. 

## 💡 Where can I try Nano Banana Pro?
It is recommended to start for free on [Copictor.com](https://copictor.com/) with a collection of artist-crafted built-in prompts.

## 🔍 Introduction
awesome-nano-banana-pro-images is a curated, community-driven collection of high-quality prompts and stunning outputs generated with the **Nano Banana Pro (Google Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview)** model.  
This repository aims to help creators, researchers, and prompt engineers better understand how to craft effective prompts for the model during its pre-release phase.


## 📌 What This Repository Contains
- Community-shared prompts that produce high-quality or interesting results  
- Example images generated via official and third-party Nano Banana Pro endpoints  
- Notes, tips, and reverse-prompt insights from real-world usage  

## 🎯 Purpose
This project serves as a practical reference for anyone experimenting with the Nano Banana Pro model. By collecting public examples and prompts from across the community, we aim to:
- Showcase what the model can achieve  
- Explore prompt patterns that lead to strong outputs  
- Help users learn and iterate faster

```
Create a comic with the title: Getting started with Nano Banana Pro 🍌. Panel 1: A mobile interface on Gemini, rendered in a poetic watercolor-ink style with fine ink outlines and soft, bleeding washes. The interface is friendly and a hand painted with expressive brushwork taps a prominent button labeled “🍌 Create image”. Above the button it should say “Choose your Model” then below there should be a checkbox that says “Thinking with 3 Pro” Muted greys and blues dominate the background. The button has a vivid yellow accent. “ Select the Thinking with 3 Pro model” and tap "Create image" to begin. Panel 2: A cheerful person is depicted adding their selfie from the phone’s camera. The user's face is drawn with soft outlines and warm pastel colors, while the phone and UI maintain the delicate water-ink aesthetic. Visible paper grain adds to the texture. Panel 3: The person thinks about what to create. In the background, different options are visualized to show what they’re thinking, including — them as a plushie, them with a mohawk hairstyle, and a figurine. These options are clearly rendered behind the person in the same style as the rest of the comic. Panel 4: The person is shown adding a style prompt, with a speech bubble saying “Transform me into a watercolor painting”. The text is integrated into the panel's watercolor-ink look, and the interaction feels natural and intuitive. Panel 5: The person is seen editing the image by simply typing into Gemini. The scene captures the ease of this interaction, with the final edited image, now in a watercolor style, appearing on the screen. The overall tone is friendly, instructional, and inspiring. It feels like a mini tutorial comic, all conveyed through the specified delicate water-ink illustration style. Make the aspect ratio 16:9.

A traditional Chinese ink and color painting in Gongbi style on aged rice paper texture. A noblewoman in elaborate Tang Dynasty Hanfu robes sits on a wooden stool, holding a modern hairdryer to dry her long flowing hair. She is wearing black stockings, red high heels on one foot, resting on a small stool. 

Three Minions dressed in ancient Chinese servant robes and hats attend to her: one on the left looks stressed holding the hairdryer's power cord, one center kneels polishing her red shoe with a cloth, and one on the right holds up a smartphone taking a photo for her. The background features classical gnarled pine trees, bamboo groves, and Taihu rocks. 

Traditional Chinese calligraphy written in the top right corner, accompanied by a red artist chop seal (寶玉). The color palette is muted mineral pigments. Humorous, anachronistic fusion. --ar 16:9

Use the provided portrait photo <YOUR PHOTO> as the base. 
Do NOT change the person’s face, expression, age, skin tone or gender. Just overlay a clean, minimal infographic on top.
Create a high-resolution vertical “FACIAL AESTHETIC REPORT” poster, studio lighting, soft beige background, premium beauty clinic style.
The subject can be MALE or FEMALE – keep them exactly as in the original photo. 
Add thin white lines and labels pointing to each area of the REAL face, with percentage scores based on global aesthetic ratios, symmetry and proportions (not changing the face):
1. Eyes:
   Label near the eyes with a line pointing to them:
   “Eyes Beauty – 0–100%”
   Example: “Eyes Beauty – 92%”
2. Cheeks:
   Label near the cheekbones:
   “Cheeks Harmony – 0–100%”
   Example: “Cheeks Harmony – 85%”
3. Lips:
   Label close to the mouth:
   “Lips Shape – 0–100%”
   Example: “Lips Shape – 88%”
4. Eyebrows:
   Label above or beside the brows:
   “Eyebrows Design – 0–100%”
   Example: “Eyebrows Design – 80%”
5. Jaw & Chin:
   Label near the jawline and chin:
   “Jaw & Chin Definition – 0–100%”
   Example: “Jaw & Chin Definition – 90%”
6. Overall Facial Symmetry:
   Label near the center of the face:
   “Facial Symmetry – 0–100%”
   Example: “Facial Symmetry – 89%”
At the bottom center of the poster, add a BIG, bold number inside a circle or rectangle:
   “OVERALL SCORE: XX%”
This is the total facial aesthetic score from 1–100%.
Design style:
– clean, medical-grade, aesthetic-clinic infographic
– modern thin sans-serif typography
– white text and lines, subtle drop shadows
– no logos, no extra graphics, no text other than the labels and scores above.
```

A hyper-realistic, high-resolution portrait infographic based on (your photo). Keep the same person, identity, hairstyle, clothing and natural skin tone from (your photo), with a neutral studio background.Overlay a subtle, semi-transparent facial analysis grid on the entire face, very similar to a 3D face-scanning mesh: thin, soft white lines following the facial contours, slightly glowing but not hiding the skin details. Add one clean vertical red laser line running down one side of the face, like a futuristic scan. All analysis lines must be soft, minimal and elegant, exactly like a cosmetic-tech advertisement.Create a clean medical–aesthetic infographic that evaluates 5 aging factors using global data percentages:1. Fine lines and wrinkles2. Skin texture and elasticity3. Facial volume and sagging4. Eye area aging signs5. Skin tone and pigmentationFor each factor, place a small label with a thin line pointing to the relevant facial area, and next to it write a short title and a realistic percentage score from 0–100% (based on global data), for example:“Fine lines & wrinkles – 18%”“Skin texture & elasticity – 72%”“Facial volume & sagging – 35%”“Eye area aging signs – 41%”“Skin tone & pigmentation – 63%”Use clean, modern, sans-serif typography and small technical-style text, like a scientific facial analysis UI. At the bottom of the image, in the center, write a large bold text showing the final estimated real age based on the analysis, for example:“ESTIMATED AGE: (random number based on face analysis ) ”Overall style: futuristic AI-guided skincare analysis, minimalistic, premium editorial lighting, no gender mentioned, suitable for any human face.
