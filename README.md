## ✨ Cases

### Case 1: [Turn item into cyberpunk style with text](https://copictor.com/case/nanobananapro)（by [@ZizheRuan](https://x.com/ZizheRuan)）

| Input | Output |
|:---:|:---:|
| <img src="images/1_i.jpg" width="300" alt="Input Image"> | <img src="images/1_o.jpg" width="300" alt="Output Result"> |


**input:** a reference image

**prompt:**

```
A highly imaginative, ultra-cool, eye-catching cyberpunk-inspired banana artwork in vivid, neon-saturated colors. A single banana occupies most of the frame, rendered in a surreal, futuristic, abstract style that clearly does not resemble the real world. 1:1 aspect ratio. Add three lines of English text: ‘Nano’, ‘Banana’, ‘Pro’. The text should not block the banana too much, but may slightly overlap if needed. Extremely stylish, futuristic, and visually striking.
```
```
以香蕉为主题，生成一张最炫酷吸睛，色彩鲜艳的香蕉主题图片，可以是抽象的赛博朋克主题，场景要非常炫酷，一看就不是真实世界，而是高度想象力的，横纵比例1:1，香蕉要占据主要面积，图上加三行英文文字，分别是"Nano""Banana""Pro"，尽量不要挡住香蕉，但也可以盖在一小部分香蕉上面，不要出现中文
```

Create a comic with the title: Getting started with Nano Banana Pro 🍌. Panel 1: A mobile interface on Gemini, rendered in a poetic watercolor-ink style with fine ink outlines and soft, bleeding washes. The interface is friendly and a hand painted with expressive brushwork taps a prominent button labeled “🍌 Create image”. Above the button it should say “Choose your Model” then below there should be a checkbox that says “Thinking with 3 Pro” Muted greys and blues dominate the background. The button has a vivid yellow accent. “ Select the Thinking with 3 Pro model” and tap "Create image" to begin. Panel 2: A cheerful person is depicted adding their selfie from the phone’s camera. The user's face is drawn with soft outlines and warm pastel colors, while the phone and UI maintain the delicate water-ink aesthetic. Visible paper grain adds to the texture. Panel 3: The person thinks about what to create. In the background, different options are visualized to show what they’re thinking, including — them as a plushie, them with a mohawk hairstyle, and a figurine. These options are clearly rendered behind the person in the same style as the rest of the comic. Panel 4: The person is shown adding a style prompt, with a speech bubble saying “Transform me into a watercolor painting”. The text is integrated into the panel's watercolor-ink look, and the interaction feels natural and intuitive. Panel 5: The person is seen editing the image by simply typing into Gemini. The scene captures the ease of this interaction, with the final edited image, now in a watercolor style, appearing on the screen. The overall tone is friendly, instructional, and inspiring. It feels like a mini tutorial comic, all conveyed through the specified delicate water-ink illustration style. Make the aspect ratio 16:9.
