## 🔍 Introduction
awesome-nano-banana-pro-images is a curated, community-driven collection of high-quality prompts and stunning outputs generated with the **Nano Banana Pro (Google Gemini 3 Pro Image Preview)** model.  
This repository aims to help creators, researchers, and prompt engineers better understand how to craft effective prompts for the model during its pre-release phase.

## 💡 Where can I try Nano Banana Pro?
It is recommended to start for free on [Copictor.com](https://copictor.com/) with a collection of artist-crafted built-in prompts, it is also maintained by me.

## 📌 What This Repository Contains
- Community-shared prompts that produce high-quality or interesting results  
- Example images generated via official and third-party Nano Banana Pro endpoints  
- Notes, tips, and reverse-prompt insights from real-world usage  

## 🎯 Purpose
This project serves as a practical reference for anyone experimenting with the Nano Banana Pro model. By collecting public examples and prompts from across the community, we aim to:
- Showcase what the model can achieve  
- Explore prompt patterns that lead to strong outputs  
- Help users learn and iterate faster

## ✨ Cases

### Case 1: [Turn item into cyberpunk style with text](https://copictor.com/model/nanobananapro)（by [@ZizheRuan](https://x.com/ZizheRuan)）

| Input | Output |
|:---:|:---:|
| <img src="images/1_i.jpg" width="300" alt="Input Image"> | <img src="images/1_o.jpg" width="300" alt="Output Result"> |


**input:** a reference image

**prompt:**

```
A highly imaginative, ultra-cool, eye-catching cyberpunk-inspired banana artwork in vivid, neon-saturated colors. A single banana occupies most of the frame, rendered in a surreal, futuristic, abstract style that clearly does not resemble the real world. 1:1 aspect ratio. Add three lines of English text: ‘Nano’, ‘Banana’, ‘Pro’. The text should not block the banana too much, but may slightly overlap if needed. Extremely stylish, futuristic, and visually striking.
```
```
以香蕉为主题，生成一张最炫酷吸睛，色彩鲜艳的香蕉主题图片，可以是抽象的赛博朋克主题，场景要非常炫酷，一看就不是真实世界，而是高度想象力的，横纵比例1:1，香蕉要占据主要面积，图上加三行英文文字，分别是"Nano""Banana""Pro"，尽量不要挡住香蕉，但也可以盖在一小部分香蕉上面，不要出现中文

**prompt:**
```
Create a comic with the title: Getting started with Nano Banana Pro 🍌. Panel 1: A mobile interface on Gemini, rendered in a poetic watercolor-ink style with fine ink outlines and soft, bleeding washes. The interface is friendly and a hand painted with expressive brushwork taps a prominent button labeled “🍌 Create image”. Above the button it should say “Choose your Model” then below there should be a checkbox that says “Thinking with 3 Pro” Muted greys and blues dominate the background. The button has a vivid yellow accent. “ Select the Thinking with 3 Pro model” and tap "Create image" to begin. Panel 2: A cheerful person is depicted adding their selfie from the phone’s camera. The user's face is drawn with soft outlines and warm pastel colors, while the phone and UI maintain the delicate water-ink aesthetic. Visible paper grain adds to the texture. Panel 3: The person thinks about what to create. In the background, different options are visualized to show what they’re thinking, including — them as a plushie, them with a mohawk hairstyle, and a figurine. These options are clearly rendered behind the person in the same style as the rest of the comic. Panel 4: The person is shown adding a style prompt, with a speech bubble saying “Transform me into a watercolor painting”. The text is integrated into the panel's watercolor-ink look, and the interaction feels natural and intuitive. Panel 5: The person is seen editing the image by simply typing into Gemini. The scene captures the ease of this interaction, with the final edited image, now in a watercolor style, appearing on the screen. The overall tone is friendly, instructional, and inspiring. It feels like a mini tutorial comic, all conveyed through the specified delicate water-ink illustration style. Make the aspect ratio 16:9.

A traditional Chinese ink and color painting in Gongbi style on aged rice paper texture. A noblewoman in elaborate Tang Dynasty Hanfu robes sits on a wooden stool, holding a modern hairdryer to dry her long flowing hair. She is wearing black stockings, red high heels on one foot, resting on a small stool. 

Three Minions dressed in ancient Chinese servant robes and hats attend to her: one on the left looks stressed holding the hairdryer's power cord, one center kneels polishing her red shoe with a cloth, and one on the right holds up a smartphone taking a photo for her. The background features classical gnarled pine trees, bamboo groves, and Taihu rocks. 

Traditional Chinese calligraphy written in the top right corner, accompanied by a red artist chop seal (寶玉). The color palette is muted mineral pigments. Humorous, anachronistic fusion. --ar 16:9
